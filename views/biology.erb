    <h2>Course Name: Cancer Biology</h2>
    <h3> Course Description:</h3>
    <p> Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Understanding the biology of cancer is crucial to 
    develop new therapies and treatments to fight this disease. This course will cover the fundamentals of cancer biology, 
    including the mechanisms underlying cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis.
    The course will start with a brief overview of normal cell biology and how it is perturbed in cancer cells. 
    We will discuss the molecular basis of cancer, including genetic mutations and alterations in signal transduction pathways. 
    Students will learn about the different types of cancers, their clinical presentation, and the current therapeutic options 
    available.
    We will also cover the role of the tumor microenvironment in promoting cancer progression and how cancer 
    cells interact with their surroundings. The course will delve into the complex mechanisms of cancer metastasis, 
    including the biology of cancer stem cells, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and the importance of the immune system 
    in cancer surveillance.</p>

    <h2>Course Name: Bioenergetics: Understanding Energy Flow in Living Systems </h2>
    <h3> Course Description</h3>
    <p> Bioenergetics is the study of the flow of energy in living systems. This course provides an in-depth understanding 
        of the principles of energy flow in living organisms, from the molecular level to the ecosystem level.
        Throughout the course, students will explore the different pathways of energy flow and transformation, 
        including photosynthesis, respiration, and fermentation. They will learn how enzymes and metabolic pathways regulate and control these processes to maintain the balance of energy within the cell.
        The course will cover the fundamental concepts of thermodynamics, including the laws of energy conservation and entropy. 
        Students will learn how these principles apply to living systems and how energy is transferred between different forms, 
        such as chemical, electrical, and thermal.
        The course will also delve into the various methods of energy production, including ATP synthesis, 
        oxidative phosphorylation, and electron transport chains. Students will gain a deep understanding of the molecular 
        mechanisms involved in these processes and how they are regulated to meet the energy demands of the organism.</p>

    <h2>Course Name: Neuro-Oncology: Understanding Brain Tumors and Treatment Options</h2>
    <h3> Course Description</h3>
    <p> This course provides a comprehensive overview of the field of neuro-oncology, including the biology of brain tumors, 
        the clinical presentation of brain tumors, and the various treatment options available for patients. Students will 
        learn about the different types of brain tumors, their molecular basis, and how they are classified. The course will cover 
        the clinical manifestations of brain tumors, including neurological symptoms, cognitive deficits, and quality of life issues.
        In addition to learning about the biology and clinical presentation of brain tumors, students will explore the different 
        treatment options available for patients with brain tumors. This will include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, 
        targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. The course will delve into the potential benefits and risks associated with each 
        treatment modality and how they are used in various contexts, such as primary and metastatic brain tumors.
        Throughout the course, students will engage with real-world cases and cutting-edge research, giving them a deeper 
        understanding of the challenges faced by neuro-oncologists and the latest advances in the field. Students will also 
        learn about the multidisciplinary approach to patient care in neuro-oncology, including the role of neurosurgeons, 
        medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and supportive care providers.</p>
