    <h2>Course Name: Introduction to Predicate Logic</h2>
    <h3> Course Description</h3>
    <p> Predicate logic is a formal system of logic that deals with the relations between objects in the world.
        This course provides an introduction to predicate logic, including its syntax, semantics, and applications. Topics covered in the course include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Propositional logic review</li>
    <li>Syntax and semantics of predicate logic</li>
    <li>Quantifiers and variables</li>
    <li>Logical equivalence and entailment</li>
    <li>Models and interpretations</li>
    <li>Predicate logic proof techniques</li>
    </ul>
    <p> By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of predicate logic and be 
        able to apply it to a range of problems in fields such as computer science, mathematics, and philosophy.</p>

    <h2>Course Name: Integration and Differentiation: Fundamentals and Applications</h2>
    <h3> Course Description</h3>
    <p>Calculus is one of the most powerful and widely used mathematical tools in science, engineering, economics,
     and many other fields. Integration and differentiation are the two main branches of calculus,
     and they form the basis for many important mathematical concepts.
     In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of integration and differentiation, 
     including their basic principles, techniques, and applications. We will cover topics such as limits, derivatives, 
     integrals, and differential equations.
     Through a series of lectures and problem-solving exercises, you will learn how to apply integration and 
     differentiation to solve real-world problems.
     By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of integration and differentiation and how 
     to apply these techniques to solve complex problems in various fields.</p>
